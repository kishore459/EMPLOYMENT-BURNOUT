# EMPLOYMENT-BURNOUT-ANALYSIS BY AIML-AICTE@IBM 


**This repository contains the Employment Burnout Analysis (EBA) project, developed as part of IBM's Machine Learning curriculum. The project focuses on analyzing employee burnout using machine learning techniques.**

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">**Project Overview**</span> 
Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress in the workplace. It can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher turnover rates. Understanding and predicting employee burnout is crucial for organizations to maintain a healthy and productive workforce.

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing various features related to employees and their work environment to predict burnout levels. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">**Getting Started**</span>  
To replicate the analysis:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kishore459/EMPLOYMENT-BURNOUT.git

Install the required packages: requirement.txt

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use pip to install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The requirements.txt file should list all dependencies. If it's not present, you may need to manually install packages such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Navigate to the project directory and open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook ProjectEBA.ipynb
Run the analysis:

Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis and model training.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Project Structure</span>
The analysis in the notebook follows these steps:

Data Loading: Importing the dataset and necessary libraries.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict employee burnout.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
